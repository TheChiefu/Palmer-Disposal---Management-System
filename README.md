# Palmer-Disposal---Management-System
Management Program for Palmer Disposal

This software was created to serve as Freeware for the **Palmer Disposal** company to use for organizing their customer data and payment history.
It is a very simple organization tool for creating a customer database and updating data.

This program was designed specifically with the company manager's requests. So all datatypes are string values, even payment.
I wanted each customer data information to be relevant to the datatype, but per request made the program around the desired design.

Warning: This program saves customer data in **PLAIN TEXT**, encryption is not implemented into this program yet since it was created in a few days to get to the client as soon as possible.

This served as a personal project and learning experience, so it is not up to enterprise level of quality.
